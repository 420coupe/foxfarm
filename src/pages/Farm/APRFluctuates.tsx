    *ShapeShift is rewarding 15,768,000 FOX until October 13, 2021 to liquidity providers that stake
    their LP tokens. This is an estimated APR calculated based on the current amount of
    FOX-ETH-UNIV2 LP tokens staked in the ShapeShift rewards contract. This APR amount is subject to
    extreme volatility and this amount could drop significantly, especially in the first few weeks
    after we roll-out FOX yield farming
